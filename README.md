# Anime_Recommender
I woke up one morning and realized I'm running low on anime, so I coded this up. It's dumb but it works <br/>
Recycled some code from Week 8 of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. <br/>
Dataset from CooperUnion/AnimeRecommendationsDatabase. If you have newer dataset, please update. <br/>
Currently configured to run a smaller dataset of 10000 reviews. Run the full dataset for the best experience. <br/>
<br/>
Programmed with Octave, using Collaborative Filtering Algorithm. 
<br/>

Basic instructions: Install Octave, input your rating in my_rating.csv, change runner.m 
to run the rating.csv instead of rating_test.csv, and extract the rar dataset (Github doesn't allow me to add more than 100 MB). Then go ham <br/>
